# Linking Through the Ages (LTTA)

***Linking Through the Ages*** (***LTTA***) is a guidebook for *Mystcraft*, a mod that adds elements from the *Myst* series of video games by [Cyan, Inc.](http://cyan.com/) *Mystcraft* does not come with any in-game instructions, so *Linking Through the Ages* is made to fill that void. Ready-to-play *jar* files are hosted on [CurseForge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/ltta).

*Linking Through the Ages* is not made to be used alone. It requires both *[Mystcraft](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/mystcraft)* and *[Guidebook](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/guidebook)* to add the guidebook and display its contents properly. By default, a book is given to every player on first spawn. You can disable this feature in the config file.

Please feel free to use the "Issues" link above to report any problems you encounter while using this mod, but I will refer you to the *Mystcraft* and/or *Guidebook* authors if the issue is with their mods.
